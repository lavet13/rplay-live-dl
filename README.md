## 📝 Description

`rplay-live-dl` monitors a configured list of RPlay creators, starts recording automatically when a stream goes live, and stores finished recordings under `archive/<creator>/`. It is designed for long-running Docker deployments where configuration, archive files, and logs are mounted from the host.

> [!WARNING]
> **Vibe Coding Notice**: versions with the `-vibe` suffix (for example `2.0.0-vibe`) are AI-assisted releases. They pass automated tests, but you should still review breaking changes before upgrading production deployments.

---

## ⚠️ v2 Upgrade Notes

`2.0.0-vibe` contains a breaking config-path change.

| Before v2       | Since `2.0.0-vibe`                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `./config.yaml` | `./config/config.yaml`               |
| mount one file  | mount the whole `./config` directory |

Upgrade checklist:

1. Move your config file from `./config.yaml` to `./config/config.yaml`.
2. Update Docker volume mounts to use `./config:/app/config`.
3. Restart the container.

Startup protection:

- if `./config/config.yaml` is missing
- and legacy `./config.yaml` still exists
- the app exits early with a migration error instead of silently starting with the wrong mount layout

## ✨ Features

- automated live monitoring for multiple creators
- automatic access-token refresh for long-running deployments (short-lived tokens are re-minted from `REFRESH_TOKEN`)
- session-aware download tracking to avoid creator-level blocking
- flat archive layout with timestamp-prefixed `.ts` files per session
- immediate merge queueing after raw download completion
- legacy-compatible final filenames such as `#Creator 2026-03-06 Title.mp4`
- duplicate title protection with suffixed outputs like `_1`, `_2`, and so on
- paid/private stream detection with blocked-session handling
- failed merge leaves raw `.ts` files in place for manual recovery
- fail-fast startup validation for legacy config path upgrades
- Docker-first deployment for long-running operation
- Docker `HEALTHCHECK` via a poll-cycle heartbeat file (`python -m core.health`)

---

<a id="quick-start"></a>

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Create your environment file: copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Create `config/config.yaml` from `config.yaml.example`.
3. Fill in your RPlay credentials, creator list, and optionally `apiBaseUrl`.
4. Optionally set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` when you want verbose lifecycle logs.
5. Start the service with Docker Compose.
6. Watch logs until the first polling cycle succeeds.

```bash
# 1) Prepare config files
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p config
cp config.yaml.example config/config.yaml

# 2) Start the service
docker compose up -d

# 3) Follow logs
docker compose logs -f
```

## 📘 Usage Guide

### System Requirements

Production:

- Docker
- valid RPlay account credentials
- stable network connectivity
- enough disk space for `.ts` recordings and final `.mp4` files

Development:

- Python 3.11+
- Poetry
- FFmpeg

### Obtaining Credentials

RPlay persists its Vuex store to `localStorage` under the `vuex` key. Parsing it exposes an `AccountModule.userInfo` object that holds every token credential this tool needs — `token` (your `AUTH_TOKEN`), `refreshToken` (your `REFRESH_TOKEN`), and `loginType`. You can read all of them from one place in the browser console:

```js
JSON.parse(localStorage.vuex).AccountModule.userInfo
```

#### `AUTH_TOKEN`

The short-lived access token. It expires roughly 10 minutes after it is issued, so on its own it is only enough to start the app once — set `REFRESH_TOKEN` (below) so the app can keep minting fresh access tokens automatically.

1. Log in to `rplay.live`
2. Open browser DevTools (`F12`) → Console
3. Execute either of:
   - `localStorage.getItem('_AUTHORIZATION_')`
   - `JSON.parse(localStorage.vuex).AccountModule.userInfo.token`
4. Copy the returned token

![auth_token](https://github.com/Zhen-Bo/rplay-live-dl/blob/main/images/auth_token.png?raw=true)

#### `REFRESH_TOKEN` (recommended)

The durable token used to mint fresh access tokens. Because `AUTH_TOKEN` expires in ~10 minutes, a deployment without `REFRESH_TOKEN` will fail authentication shortly after starting (the container logs `Invalid authentication response` and restart-loops). With `REFRESH_TOKEN` set, the app refreshes the access token before it expires and runs indefinitely.

1. Log in to `rplay.live`
2. Open browser DevTools (`F12`) → Console
3. Execute:
   ```js
   JSON.parse(localStorage.vuex).AccountModule.userInfo.refreshToken
   ```
4. Copy the returned value

> Unlike `AUTH_TOKEN`, the refresh token is stable — the same value keeps working, so you paste it once into `.env` and leave it.

#### `USER_OID`

1. Visit `https://rplay.live/myinfo/`
2. Copy your `User Number`

![user_oid](https://github.com/Zhen-Bo/rplay-live-dl/blob/main/images/user_oid.png?raw=true)

#### Creator ID

1. Visit the creator profile page
2. Open DevTools → Network
3. Refresh the page and search for `CreatorOid`
4. Copy the creator ID

![creator_oid](https://github.com/Zhen-Bo/rplay-live-dl/blob/main/images/creator_oid.png?raw=true)

### Configuration

#### Environment file

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Both local runs and the bundled `docker-compose.yaml` use `.env`.

Full example:

```dotenv
# Required: RPlay account credentials
AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
USER_OID=your_user_oid

# Recommended: refresh token used to auto-mint fresh access tokens.
# AUTH_TOKEN expires ~10 minutes after you copy it; without this the
# container fails authentication shortly after starting. Get it from the
# browser console at rplay.live:
#   JSON.parse(localStorage.vuex).AccountModule.userInfo.refreshToken
REFRESH_TOKEN=

# Optional: monitor poll interval in seconds (10-3600)
INTERVAL=60

MIN_FREE_DISK_GB=5

# Optional: application log level
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Optional: surface yt-dlp internal debug chatter
# truthy: 1/true/yes/on; falsy: 0/false/no/off/empty; other values abort startup
LOG_YTDLP_INTERNAL=false

# Optional: log rotation settings
LOG_MAX_SIZE_MB=5
LOG_BACKUP_COUNT=5
LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=30

# Optional: startup metadata shown as Git SHA in logs
# Usually injected automatically during Docker image builds
APP_GIT_SHA=
```

Notes:

- local runs load from `.env` or process environment variables
- the bundled Docker Compose file loads `.env` through `env_file`, so its values become real container environment variables
- `AUTH_TOKEN` is short-lived (~10 minutes). Set `REFRESH_TOKEN` so the app can mint fresh access tokens automatically before each poll; without it, recording stops once `AUTH_TOKEN` expires
- `REFRESH_TOKEN` is stable — the refresh call returns a new access token but no new refresh token, so the same value keeps working
- `LOG_YTDLP_INTERNAL=true` is only for deep diagnosis; it is intentionally noisy

#### Creator configuration

Copy `config.yaml.example` to `config/config.yaml` and edit it like this:

```yaml
# Optional. If missing, the app uses the default below without modifying this file.
apiBaseUrl: https://api.rplay.live

creators:
  - name: "Creator Nickname 1"
    id: "Creator OID 1"
  - name: "Creator Nickname 2"
    id: "Creator OID 2"
```

Configuration keys:

| Key               | Required | Default                  | Validation                                                                  | Purpose                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `apiBaseUrl`      | no       | `https://api.rplay.live` | absolute URL; surrounding whitespace is trimmed and trailing `/` is removed | Base URL for the RPlay API                                   |
| `creators`        | no       | empty list               | YAML list                                                                   | Creators to monitor                                          |
| `creators[].name` | yes      | none                     | non-empty, max `100` characters                                             | Display name used in logs, folder names, and final filenames |
| `creators[].id`   | yes      | none                     | non-empty                                                                   | Creator OID from the RPlay profile/network requests          |

Notes:

- if `apiBaseUrl` is missing, the app uses the default in memory and leaves `config/config.yaml` untouched
- the monitor re-reads `config/config.yaml` on every poll, so updating `apiBaseUrl` in a running Docker deployment does not require a container restart
- an invalid `apiBaseUrl` is treated as a config error and the current poll is skipped until the file is fixed
- you can temporarily leave `creators: []` while validating a deployment

### Download and Merge Flow

The v2 runtime uses a session-aware download pipeline.

1. **Poll**
   - the monitor loads `config/config.yaml`
   - it refreshes `apiBaseUrl` from config before calling the API
   - when `REFRESH_TOKEN` is set, it refreshes the access token if it is missing or within 60 seconds of expiry; otherwise it uses `AUTH_TOKEN` as-is
   - it checks live status for all configured creators

2. **Create a session**
   - each live stream gets a session key based on `creator_oid` and the local recording start time (`recording_started_at`), not the API stream `oid`
   - a timestamp prefix (`YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_`) is derived from `recording_started_at` in machine local time
   - raw files are written directly to `archive/<creator>/` using this prefix for isolation

3. **Download raw transport stream files**
   - yt-dlp writes raw outputs as `.ts` directly into `archive/<creator>/`
   - each download task uses a `10`-second socket timeout
   - transient task failures automatically retry up to `3` attempts total with exponential backoff
   - `HTTP 404` on the stream playlist is retried with exponential backoff before the session is marked blocked
   - `HTTP 403` is still treated as immediate blocked/private access
   - `HTTP 401` is treated as an authentication failure instead of a blocked session
   - raw filenames carry the session timestamp prefix, for example:
     - `20260306_120000_#Creator 2026-03-06 Title.ts`
     - `20260306_120000_#Creator 2026-03-06 Title_1.ts`

4. **Queue merge immediately after download completes**
   - as soon as raw download finishes, the merge job is submitted to the merge executor
   - the control loop can move on quickly, so a new live session from the same creator can be picked up without waiting for the old merge to finish

5. **Merge into final `.mp4`**
   - all `.ts` files in `archive/<creator>/` matching the session prefix are merged into one final `.mp4`
   - even if only one raw `.ts` file exists, the final visible output is still `.mp4`

6. **Clean up or preserve for recovery**
   - on success, the `.ts` files matching the session prefix are deleted from `archive/<creator>/`
   - on merge failure, the `.ts` files remain in `archive/<creator>/` for manual inspection and recovery

7. **Observe lifecycle logs**
   - set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in `.env` to see stream-candidate evaluation and skip reasons
   - set `LOG_YTDLP_INTERNAL=true` only when you need raw yt-dlp internal chatter in addition to app logs
   - the default `INFO` level keeps routine output readable for long-running Docker deployments

#### Final filename rules

Visible final outputs use a clean naming style:

- first session: `#Creator 2026-03-06 Title.mp4`
- second session on the same day with the same title: `#Creator 2026-03-06 Title_1.mp4`
- later duplicates continue as `_2`, `_3`, and so on

Raw `.ts` files carry a timestamp prefix for session isolation:

- `20260306_120000_#Creator 2026-03-06 Title.ts`
- prefix format is `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_` in machine local time
- prefix uniquely identifies the recording session; files from different sessions never collide

### Deployment

#### Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
# Start recording
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop recording
docker compose down

# Update image and restart
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The bundled `docker-compose.yaml` reads `./.env` via `env_file`, and mounts:

- `./config` → `/app/config`
- `./archive` → `/app/archive`
- `./logs` → `/app/logs`

#### Docker directly

```bash
docker run -d \
  --env-file .env \
  -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config \
  -v $(pwd)/archive:/app/archive \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs \
  paverz/rplay-live-dl:latest
```

#### Docker healthcheck

The image runs `python -m core.health` every 60s (`--retries=3`). Healthy when `/tmp/rplay-live-dl-heartbeat` exists and its mtime is strictly fresher than `3 × INTERVAL` seconds (touched once per monitor poll cycle, including failed ones). Docker only _displays_ unhealthy status; it does not restart the container. With default `INTERVAL=60`, probes start failing after 180s without a heartbeat update, and Docker marks the container unhealthy ~300–360s after the last heartbeat update.

### Directory Structure

Typical runtime layout:

```text
rplay-live-dl/
├── archive/
│   └── Creator/
│       ├── #Creator 2026-03-06 Title.mp4
│       ├── #Creator 2026-03-06 Title_1.mp4
│       ├── 20260306_120000_#Creator 2026-03-06 Title.ts    ← active or failed session
│       └── 20260306_130000_#Creator 2026-03-06 Title.ts    ← active or failed session
├── config/
│   ├── .gitkeep
│   └── config.yaml
├── .env                 # credentials and runtime settings
├── logs/
└── docker-compose.yaml
```

Notes:

- `.ts` files with a timestamp prefix are either active downloads or unmerged fragments from a failed session
- on successful merge the matching `.ts` files are deleted automatically
- on merge failure the `.ts` files remain in place for manual inspection and recovery
- final user-facing recordings live directly under `archive/<creator>/`

### Troubleshooting

#### 1. Startup fails after upgrading to v2

Symptom:

- the app exits with a config migration error

Cause:

- `./config.yaml` still exists, but `./config/config.yaml` does not

Fix:

- move `./config.yaml` to `./config/config.yaml`
- update Docker to mount `./config:/app/config`

#### 2. Stream is not recording

Check:

- `AUTH_TOKEN` is still valid
- `REFRESH_TOKEN` is set and valid (`AUTH_TOKEN` alone expires in ~10 minutes, so without a refresh token recording stops shortly after startup)
- `USER_OID` is correct
- creator ID is correct
- there is enough free disk space
- logs do not show API or connection failures

#### 3. Authentication fails at startup (`Invalid authentication response`)

Behavior:

- the app logs `Authentication failed: Invalid authentication response` and exits, then restarts

Cause:

- the access token was already expired by the time the container started, and no valid `REFRESH_TOKEN` is available to mint a fresh one

Check:

- set `REFRESH_TOKEN` in `.env` (see [Obtaining Credentials](#obtaining-credentials)); this is the usual fix
- if `REFRESH_TOKEN` is set and it still fails, the refresh token itself may be stale — grab a fresh value from `JSON.parse(localStorage.vuex).AccountModule.userInfo.refreshToken`
- confirm `USER_OID` matches your `User Number` at `https://rplay.live/myinfo/`

#### 4. Stream access fails (`401` / `403` / `404`)

Behavior:

- `401` usually means `AUTH_TOKEN` is missing, expired, or invalid
- `403` is treated as immediate blocked/private/paid access
- `404` can appear for a few seconds right after stream start; the downloader retries automatically before marking the current session blocked
- timeout-like transport errors also retry automatically within the same download task
- after retries are exhausted, the current session is marked blocked or failed according to the final error
- a later new session from that creator can still be retried normally

Check:

- refresh `AUTH_TOKEN` if logs show `401`
- if repeated `403` persists, confirm the stream is not paid/private for your account
- if repeated `404` persists after the automatic retries, wait a few seconds and confirm the stream actually remained live

#### 5. Merge failed

Behavior:

- the `.ts` files matching the failed session prefix remain in `archive/<creator>/`
- the app does not silently delete the session fragments

Check:

- FFmpeg availability in the runtime image
- file-system permissions
- available disk space
- the preserved raw `.ts` files in `archive/<creator>/` for manual recovery

#### 6. Shutdown takes time

Behavior:
